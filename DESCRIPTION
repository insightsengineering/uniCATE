Description: uniCATE implements an efficient semiparametric procedure for the
  estimation of individual variables' conditional average treatment effects'
  linear approximations. This method can identify potential predictive
  biomarkers in randomized and observational studies using assumption-lean
  statistical inference techniques that rely on flexible machine learning
  algorithms.
