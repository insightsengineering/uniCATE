------------------------------------------------------------------------

`uniCATE` implements an efficient semiparametric procedure for the
estimation of individual variables’ conditional average treatment
effects’ best linear approximations. This method can identify potential
predictive biomarkers in randomized and observational studies using
assumption-lean statistical inference techniques that rely on flexible
machine learning algorithms.
